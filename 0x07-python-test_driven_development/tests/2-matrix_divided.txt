 How to Use doctest_in_help.py
===============================

This library is very simple, since it only has one function called
``matrix_divided``.

Numbers
=======

``matrix_divided`` returns a matrix divided by each div number.

::

	>>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided
	>>> matrix = [[2, 4, 6, 8, 10], [3, 6, 9, 12, 15], [4, 8, 12, 16, 20]]
	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
	[[0.67, 1.33, 2.0, 2.67, 3.33], [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0], [1.33, 2.67, 4.0, 5.33, 6.67]]

Adding a new matrix

::

	>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
	[[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]

Adding a str in a matrix

::

	>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], ['isaac', 5, 'DLH']]
	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
	Traceback (most recent call last):
		  ...
	TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Adding not the same number of row

::

	>>> matrix = [[1, 2], [1, 2, 3]]
	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
	Traceback (most recent call last):
		  ...
	TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size

Adding a str and different number of row

::

	>>> matrix = [[1, 2, "i"], [1, 23]]
	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 4)
	Traceback (most recent call last):
		  ...
	TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

::

	>>> matrix = [["2", 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [3, 4, 5]]
	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 4)
	Traceback (most recent call last):
		  ...
	TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Adding a row without one element

::

	>>> matrix = [[2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [3, 4, 5]]
	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 4)
	Traceback (most recent call last):
		  ...
	TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size

Adding row without elements

::

	>>> matrix = [[2, 3], [1, 2], []]
	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 4)
	Traceback (most recent call last):
		  ...
	TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size

Trying with division by zero

::

	>>> matrix = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 0)
	Traceback (most recent call last):
                ...
	ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

Trying without division module

::


	>>> matrix_divided([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], "12")
	Traceback (most recent call last):
		  ...
	TypeError: div must be a number

Try with 'inf'

::


	>>> matrix_divided([[1, 2], [2, 1]], float('inf'))
	[[0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0]]

Trying without arguments

::


	>>> matrix_divided()
	Traceback (most recent call last):
		  ...
	TypeError: matrix_divided() missing 2 required positional arguments: 'matrix' and 'div'

Trying with a single arguments

::


	>>> matrix_divided([1,2])
	Traceback (most recent call last):
		  ...
	TypeError: matrix_divided() missing 1 required positional argument: 'div'
