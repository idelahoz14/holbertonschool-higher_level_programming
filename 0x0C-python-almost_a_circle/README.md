## Background Context
The AirBnB project is a big part of the Higher level curriculum. This project will help you be ready for it.
In this project, you will review everything about Python:

* Import
* Import
* Exceptions
* Class
* Private attribute
* Getter/Setter
* Class method
* Static method
* Inheritance
* Unittest
* Read/Write file

## Leaning objectives
With this project we could learn about the next topics:

* What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project
* How to serialize and deserialize a Class
* How to write and read a JSON file
* What is *args and how to use it
* What is **kwargs and how to use it
* How to handle named arguments in a function

## Requirements
### Python scripts
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
* Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.*)
* The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3

### Python Unit Tests
* All your test files should be inside a folder **tests**
* All your test files should be python files (extension: **.py**)
* All your test files and folders should start with **test_**
* Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project: ex: for **models/base.py**, unit tests must be in: **tests/test_models/test_base.py**
* All your tests should be executed by using this command: **python3 -m unittest discover tests**
* You can also test file by file by using this command: **python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base.py**
